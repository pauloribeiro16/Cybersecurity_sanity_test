It defines *what* security must be achieved (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non\u2011repudiation, auditability) and *how* it is measured or verified.\n\nKey points:\n\n| Aspect | Explanation |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **Purpose** | Guides design, implementation, and testing to ensure the system meets protection goals and regulatory obligations. |\n| **Scope** | Covers all security aspects, including data, processes, and people. |\n| **Nature** | Often expressed in a testable form: \u201cUser X must be able to authenticate with two\u2011factor authentication before accessing sensitive data.\u201d |\n| **Difference from functional requirements** | Functional requirements describe *what* the system does; security requirements describe *how* it does it safely. |\n| **Examples** | \u2022 All stored passwords must be salted and hashed with a strong algorithm.<br>\u2022 The system shall log all administrative actions and retain logs for 90 days.<br>\u2022 The application must enforce role\u2011based access control with least privilege. |\n\nSecurity requirements are usually captured in a requirements document, tracked through the development lifecycle, and validated by security testing or audits.",
