SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in a Web Context**, represents a **cross-site scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. It occurs when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being displayed in a web page, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts (like JavaScript) that can be executed by other users' browsers.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main difference is **scope and enforcement**. 

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** is a comprehensive EU law governing the processing of personal data of individuals *within* the EU. It applies to any organization processing EU citizens' data, regardless of where the organization is located. It has strong enforcement with significant fines.

*   **NIS 2 Directive (Network and Information Systems Directive)** focuses on cybersecurity of essential services *within* the EU. It mandates cybersecurity requirements for organizations providing essential services (energy, transport, banking, etc.) and requires them to report cybersecurity incidents. It's less about data privacy and more about operational resilience and security.

In short: **GDPR protects *personal data*, NIS 2 protects *critical infrastructure and services* from cyberattacks.**

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.
