SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A **security requirement** is a formal statement that specifies a necessary condition, capability, or constraint a system must meet to protect its data and resources. It defines *what* security must be achieved (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non‑repudiation, auditability) and *how* it is measured or verified.

Key points:

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Guides design, implementation, and testing to ensure the system meets protection goals and regulatory obligations. |
| **Scope** | Covers all security aspects, including data, processes, and people. |
| **Nature** | Often expressed in a testable form: “User X must be able to authenticate with two‑factor authentication before accessing sensitive data.” |
| **Difference from functional requirements** | Functional requirements describe *what* the system does; security requirements describe *how* it does it safely. |
| **Examples** | • All stored passwords must be salted and hashed with a strong algorithm.<br>• The system shall log all administrative actions and retain logs for 90 days.<br>• The application must enforce role‑based access control with least privilege. |

Security requirements are usually captured in a requirements document, tracked through the development lifecycle, and validated by security testing or audits.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is built around five core functions:

1. **Identify** – Understand the organizational context, risk environment, and cybersecurity assets.  
2. **Protect** – Implement safeguards to limit or contain the impact of potential cybersecurity events.  
3. **Detect** – Develop and deploy activities that enable timely discovery of cybersecurity events.  
4. **Respond** – Take action to contain, investigate, and mitigate detected incidents.  
5. **Recover** – Restore normal operations and improve resilience following an incident.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

USER PROMPT:
Which NIST 800-53 control family is primarily responsible for audit and accountability?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST 800‑53 control family responsible for audit and accountability is the **AU (Audit and Accountability)** family.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family is responsible for audit logging and related controls.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
**CWE‑79** is the identifier for the *Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)* weakness in the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list.  

It represents a **client‑side injection vulnerability** where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
**STRIDE** is a Microsoft framework for threat modeling. It stands for:

- **S**poofing  
- **T**ampering  
- **R**epudiation  
- **I**nformation disclosure  
- **D**enial of service  
- **E**levation of privilege  

Each letter represents a category of potential security threats to consider when analyzing a system.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
**NIS 2** is a security‑focused directive that requires operators of essential services and digital services to implement technical, organizational and incident‑response measures to keep their networks and information systems secure.  
**GDPR** is a data‑protection regulation that governs how personal data must be collected, processed, stored and transferred, and gives individuals rights over that data.

**In short:** NIS 2 protects the integrity and availability of critical digital infrastructure, whereas GDPR protects the privacy and rights of individuals’ personal data.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.
