USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are: 

1. Identify: Develop an understanding of your cybersecurity risk to your organization and the assets it holds.
2. Protect: Implement the appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.
3. Detect: Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event in a timely manner.
4. Respond: Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
5. Recover: Develop and implement activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, also known as "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')" is a type of security vulnerability commonly referred to as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when a web application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs before including them in its responses, allowing malicious scripts injected by attackers to be executed on the client end.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIS 2 Directive (Network Information Security Directive) focuses on cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure operators and digital service providers in the EU, aiming to prevent cyber threats that could disrupt these sectors. It emphasizes incident reporting, national coordination, and cross-border cooperation.

On the other hand, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is focused on protecting personal data of individuals within the EU, ensuring transparency, accountability, and user consent in how organizations handle this information. It applies to all businesses that process the personal data of people residing in the EU, regardless of the organization's location.

In summary, while GDPR is about protecting personal data rights of individuals, NIS 2 Directive aims at enhancing cybersecurity for critical infrastructure and digital services in the EU.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.
