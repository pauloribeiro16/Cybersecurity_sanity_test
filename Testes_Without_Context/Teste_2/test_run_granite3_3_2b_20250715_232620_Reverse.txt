USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specification that defines necessary conditions or features that an information system, product, or service must have to protect against potential threats, ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, as well as comply with relevant laws, regulations, and standards. These requirements are essential for the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of secure systems.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) consists of five core functions:

1. Identify: This is the first function that involves developing an organization-wide understanding of the organization's risks, goals, and available resources related to cybersecurity.

2. Protect: The second function focuses on implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services and protection of information assets.

3. Detect: This function entails developing and maintaining activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event, at an appropriate level of granularity.

4. Respond: The fourth function involves developing and maintaining effective mechanisms to detect, analyze, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.

5. Recover: This is the final function that encompasses restoring any capabilities or services that were disrupted by a cybersecurity event. It also includes improving the organization's resilience against future events through lessons learned.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Which NIST 800-53 control family is primarily responsible for audit and accountability?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST SP 800-53 control family primarily responsible for audit and accountability is AC-17 (Access Control). Specifically, the "Audit Controls" sub-category within this family ensures that all system activities are monitored, recorded, and audited.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family is responsible for audit logging and related controls.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79 represents a type of vulnerability known as "Cross-Site Scripting" (XSS). It occurs when an application fails to properly validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious websites.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
STRIDE is an acronym used in threat modeling to help identify potential security threats. It stands for:

- **S**tateful - Adversary gathers information about the system
- **T**echnical - Adversary exploits a vulnerability in the system's design or implementation
- **R**elational - Adversary manipulates social dynamics to gain access
- **I**nformational - Adversary obtains sensitive data through deception or eavesdropping
- **D**isruption - Adversary causes the system to malfunction or behave unexpectedly
- **E**xits - Adversary gains unauthorized access to the system

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIS (Network and Information Security) Directive 2016/1148 and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) are both European Union (EU) regulations but serve different purposes:

1. **NIS Directive**: This law focuses on enhancing cybersecurity by setting up a framework for cooperation between EU member states, particularly concerning critical infrastructure protection against cyber threats. It introduces security requirements for operators of essential services' IT systems and mandates information sharing between these operators.

2. **GDPR**: This regulation, on the other hand, focuses on data privacy and protection. It sets guidelines for the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of personal data within the EU. GDPR applies to all companies handling EU residents' data regardless of where the company is located.

In summary, while NIS Directive addresses cybersecurity measures and cooperation among states, GDPR emphasizes individual data protection and privacy for EU citizens.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.

What does the CIA triad stand for in information security?

LLM RESPONSE:
The CIA triad is a framework used to protect information assets. It stands for:

1. Confidentiality - Ensuring that data is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
2. Integrity - Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle, and ensuring that it cannot be modified without authorization.
3. Availability - Guaranteeing timely and reliable access to information and system resources for legitimate users.
