SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specific condition that must be met to protect an asset (data, system, etc.) from a threat. It defines *what* security needs to be achieved, not *how*. 

Essentially, it's a statement outlining a security goal. Examples include: "All passwords must be at least 12 characters long" or "Data at rest must be encrypted."

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are:

1. **Identify:** Understanding your organization's assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Protect:** Developing and implementing safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets.
3. **Detect:** Activities related to identifying cybersecurity events and threats.
4. **Respond:** Actions taken after a cybersecurity incident occurs to contain the impact and restore normal operations.
5. **Recover:** Planning for and executing the restoration of systems, data, and operations after a cybersecurity incident.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, **External Control of File Name or Path**, represents a **path traversal vulnerability**. 

It occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without proper validation, allowing attackers to manipulate the path to access files and directories outside the intended application directory. This can lead to unauthorized file reading, writing, or execution.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
STRIDE stands for **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation Disclosure, **D**enial of Service, and **E**levation of Privilege. It's a categorization of threats used in threat modeling.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main difference is **scope and enforcement.**

*   **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** is a comprehensive, EU-wide law governing the processing of personal data of individuals *within* the EU. It applies to any organization processing EU citizens' data, regardless of the organization's location. It's directly enforceable by national data protection authorities.

*   **NIS 2 Directive (Network and Information Security Directive 2)** focuses on cybersecurity and the resilience of essential services *within* the EU. It applies to organizations providing essential services (energy, transport, banking, etc.) and digital service providers. It's enforced through national authorities, with the EU setting minimum standards.

Essentially, GDPR is about *data privacy*, while NIS 2 is about *cybersecurity* of critical infrastructure. While there can be overlap (e.g., a data breach affecting an essential service), their primary objectives and legal frameworks are distinct.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.

What does the CIA triad stand for in information security?

LLM RESPONSE:
The CIA triad stands for:

*   **Confidentiality:** Protecting information from unauthorized access.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring information is accurate and unaltered.
*   **Availability:** Guaranteeing authorized users have timely and reliable access to information.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
