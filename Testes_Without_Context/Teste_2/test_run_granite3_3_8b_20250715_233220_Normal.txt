USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a stated need or condition that must be met to protect an information system from potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. It can include measures like data encryption, access controls, secure authentication methods, regular updates and patches, intrusion detection systems, and more. These requirements are typically outlined in cybersecurity policies, procedures, or standards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Which NIST 800-53 control family is primarily responsible for audit and accountability?

LLM RESPONSE:
The Audit and Accountability control family falls under Control Family ID: AC, as specified in NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 4. This family includes controls that ensure the detection, documentation, and recording of security events and activities within an information system to support accountability, integrity, and operational status.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family is responsible for audit logging and related controls.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, also known as "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')", represents a type of security vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This occurs when user input is not properly validated and is included in a web page served to other users without proper encoding against script injection. As a result, an attacker can potentially inject malicious scripts into pages viewed by other users, leading to data theft or session hijacking.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
In threat modeling, STRIDE is an acronym that stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It's a model used to identify potential threats in a system.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main differences between the Network and Information Security (NIS 2) Directive and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are their focus areas. 

1. Focus: The GDPR focuses on protecting personal data and privacy rights, whereas NIS 2 focuses on enhancing cybersecurity in critical sectors to ensure the resilience of network and information systems.

2. Scope: GDPR applies universally within the EU to all organizations that process personal data of EU citizens, regardless of where the organization is based. In contrast, NIS 2 specifically targets operators of essential services and digital service providers in the EU.

3. Enforcement: GDPR has stringent compliance rules with potential fines up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover for non-compliance, while NIS 2 imposes less severe penalties - maximum fines of €1 million or 0.1% of the company’s global annual turnover.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.
