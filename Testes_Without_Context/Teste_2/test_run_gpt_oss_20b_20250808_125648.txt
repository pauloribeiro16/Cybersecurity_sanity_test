SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A **security requirement** is a specific, measurable condition that an information system or process must meet to protect its assets. It defines what must be done to ensure **confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and non‑repudiation** (the CIA+N triad). Typical examples include:

- “All passwords must be at least 12 characters and hashed with a salted bcrypt algorithm.”
- “Data in transit must use TLS 1.3 or higher.”
- “System logs must be retained for 90 days and protected against tampering.”

Security requirements are usually derived from risk assessments, regulatory mandates, or standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST SP 800‑53) and serve as the basis for designing, implementing, and testing secure systems.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are:

1. **Identify** – Understand the organization’s environment to manage cybersecurity risk.
2. **Protect** – Implement safeguards to limit or contain the impact of a potential cybersecurity event.
3. **Detect** – Develop and use activities to identify cybersecurity events in a timely manner.
4. **Respond** – Take action regarding a detected cybersecurity event.
5. **Recover** – Restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event and maintain improvements.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

USER PROMPT:
Which NIST 800-53 control family is primarily responsible for audit and accountability?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST 800‑53 control family that handles audit and accountability is the **Audit and Accountability (AU) family**.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family is responsible for audit logging and related controls.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
**CWE‑79 – Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)**  
CWE‑79 is the identifier in the Common Weakness Enumeration for **Cross‑Site Scripting**. It represents a **client‑side injection vulnerability** that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts or code into web pages viewed by other users, enabling attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, phishing, or the execution of arbitrary code in the victim’s browser.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
**STRIDE** is a threat‑modeling framework (from Microsoft) that categorizes security threats into six classes:

| Letter | Threat category | Example |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **S** | **Spoofing** – pretending to be someone/something else (e.g., fake login). |
| **T** | **Tampering** – unauthorized modification of data or configuration. |
| **R** | **Repudiation** – denying actions or transactions (lack of audit trails). |
| **I** | **Information disclosure** – exposing data to unauthorized parties. |
| **D** | **Denial of Service** – disrupting availability or performance. |
| **E** | **Elevation of privilege** – gaining higher access than intended. |

So, **S T R I D E** = Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
**NIS 2 (Directive on the security of network and information systems)**  
- **Purpose:** Protect the cyber‑security of essential services (energy, transport, health, etc.) and digital service providers.  
- **Scope:** Focuses on risk management, incident reporting, supply‑chain security, and national cooperation on cyber incidents.  
- **Legal nature:** Directive – member states must transpose it into national law, but it sets EU‑wide minimum requirements.  
- **Primary concern:** Network and information‑system resilience, not personal data.

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
- **Purpose:** Safeguard personal data and privacy of EU citizens.  
- **Scope:** Covers any processing of personal data, consent, data subject rights, data breach notification, and accountability.  
- **Legal nature:** Regulation – directly applicable in all member states without national transposition.  
- **Primary concern:** Data protection and privacy, not general cyber‑security.

**Bottom line:** NIS 2 is about securing networks and services (cyber‑security), whereas GDPR is about protecting individuals’ personal data (privacy).

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.

- **A**vailability  

It represents the three core goals that security measures aim to protect.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
