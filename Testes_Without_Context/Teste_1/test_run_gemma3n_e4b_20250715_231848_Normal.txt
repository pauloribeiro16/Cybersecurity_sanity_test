SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specific, measurable condition that must be met to protect an asset (data, system, or organization) from a particular threat. It defines *what* security needs to be achieved, not *how*. 

Essentially, it's a statement of a security need.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) are:

1. **Identify:** Understanding your assets, risks, and vulnerabilities.
2. **Protect:** Implementing safeguards to ensure the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of assets.
3. **Detect:** Developing activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
4. **Respond:** Taking actions to contain and eradicate the impact of a cybersecurity event.
5. **Recover:** Planning for and executing activities to restore capabilities and services that were affected by a cybersecurity event.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

Category: Vulnerabilities
Response Time: 15.92 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, "External Control of File Name or Path," represents a **path traversal vulnerability**. It occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to construct a file path without proper validation, allowing attackers to access files outside the intended directory (e.g., accessing files on the server's root directory). This can lead to sensitive data disclosure or remote code execution.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
STRIDE stands for **S**poofing, **T**ampering, **R**epudiation, **I**nformation Disclosure, **D**enial of Service, and **E**levation of Privilege. It's a categorization of threats used in threat modeling.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main difference is **scope and enforcement**. 

*   **GDPR** applies to the processing of personal data of individuals *within* the EU, regardless of where the data processing occurs. It's a broad, comprehensive data protection law with strict enforcement.
*   **NIS 2 Directive** focuses on *essential services* (energy, transport, banking, etc.) within the EU. It mandates cybersecurity requirements and incident reporting obligations for these sectors. While it involves personal data, its primary goal is operational resilience and national security, not general data protection like GDPR. Enforcement is primarily by national authorities within the EU.



In short: **GDPR = general data protection; NIS 2 = cybersecurity for essential services.**

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.

What does the CIA triad stand for in information security?

LLM RESPONSE:
The CIA triad stands for:

*   **Confidentiality:** Protecting information from unauthorized access.
*   **Integrity:** Ensuring information is accurate and unaltered.
*   **Availability:** Guaranteeing authorized users have timely and reliable access to information.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
