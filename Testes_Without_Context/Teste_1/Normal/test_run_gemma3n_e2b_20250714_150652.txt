SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) statement that outlines what security controls *must* be implemented to protect information and assets. It defines the desired security outcome. 

Essentially, it's a clear specification of a security need.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
**CWE-79: Improper Handling of External Data**

This vulnerability represents a **data-related vulnerability**. It occurs when an application doesn't properly validate or sanitize data received from an external source (e.g., user input, network data, files). 

**In essence, it's a vulnerability where the application doesn't adequately protect itself from malicious or unexpected data.** This can lead to various issues like:

*   **Injection attacks:**  Malicious code can be injected into the data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application can be overwhelmed by excessive or malformed data.
*   **Information disclosure:** Sensitive data can be exposed.
*   **Data corruption:**  The application's state can be altered.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main difference is that **NIS Directive focuses on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, while GDPR focuses on the protection of personal data.** 

*   **NIS Directive:**  Aims to improve cybersecurity across Europe's critical infrastructure (energy, transport, digital, etc.) by requiring operators to implement cybersecurity measures.
*   **GDPR:**  A data protection regulation governing the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU. It sets strict rules about data collection, storage, and use.
