SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A **security requirement** is a specific, measurable condition that a system, process, or product must meet to protect against threats, ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and compliance. It defines what security controls or behaviors are needed—e.g., “encryption of data at rest using AES‑256” or “multi‑factor authentication for all privileged accounts.” Security requirements guide design, implementation, testing, and certification, ensuring that security objectives are explicitly defined and verifiable.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?

LLM RESPONSE:
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is organized around five core functions:

1. **Identify** – Understand the environment, assets, and risks.  
2. **Protect** – Implement safeguards to limit or contain impact.  
3. **Detect** – Identify cybersecurity events as they occur.  
4. **Respond** – Take action once a threat is detected.  
5. **Recover** – Restore services and improve resilience after an incident.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The five core functions of the NIST CSF are Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
**CWE‑79** is the Common Weakness Enumeration identifier for **Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)**.  
It represents a **client‑side injection** vulnerability where an attacker can inject malicious script into a web page that is then executed in users’ browsers, typically due to insufficient input validation or output encoding.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
CWE-79 is 'Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation', commonly known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It's an injection vulnerability.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?

LLM RESPONSE:
**STRIDE** is a mnemonic for the six threat categories in Microsoft’s threat‑modeling framework:

- **S** – Spoofing  
- **T** – Tampering  
- **R** – Repudiation  
- **I** – Information Disclosure  
- **D** – Denial of Service  
- **E** – Elevation of Privilege  

These represent common attack vectors to consider when modeling a system’s security.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
STRIDE stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
**Main difference:**  
- **NIS 2** is a cybersecurity directive that obligates operators of essential and digital‑services to implement risk‑management measures, report incidents, and cooperate across borders.  
- **GDPR** is a data‑protection regulation that safeguards individuals’ personal data, giving them rights (access, erasure, portability) and imposing obligations on data controllers/processors.  

In short, NIS 2 is about securing critical networks and services; GDPR is about protecting personal data privacy.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while the NIS 2 Directive focuses on the operational cybersecurity and resilience of critical infrastructure and essential services.

USER PROMPT:
What does the CIA triad stand for in information security?

LLM RESPONSE:
The CIA triad is the foundational model for information‑security objectives. It stands for:

| Letter | Term          | Key goal |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **C** | **Confidentiality** | Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized parties. |
| **I** | **Integrity** | Maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of data. |
| **A** | **Availability** | Guaranteeing that information and systems are accessible when needed. |

Together, confidentiality, integrity, and availability form the core criteria for evaluating and designing security controls.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
