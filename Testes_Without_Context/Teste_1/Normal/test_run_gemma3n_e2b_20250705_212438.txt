SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specific, measurable, and often prioritized need that must be met to protect an asset or system from threats. It outlines *what* needs to be secured and *how* it needs to be protected. 

Essentially, it's a statement of what security controls are needed to achieve a desired security outcome.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?

LLM RESPONSE:
CWE-79, "Improper Input Validation," represents a **vulnerability due to inadequate validation of user-supplied input**. 

It means the application doesn't properly check the format, type, or range of data received from the user, leading to potential exploitation. This can result in various issues like:

*   **Injection attacks:**  Malicious code being inserted into the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The application crashing or becoming unresponsive due to invalid input.
*   **Information disclosure:**  Sensitive data being revealed.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?

LLM RESPONSE:
The main difference is **scope and focus**. 

*   **NIS Directive:** Focuses on cybersecurity of essential infrastructure and aims to improve cybersecurity across the EU. It's about *operational resilience*.
*   **GDPR:** Focuses on the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU. It's about *data protection and individual rights*.

Essentially, NIS 2 is about protecting systems from cyberattacks, while GDPR is about protecting individuals' data privacy. They are distinct but complementary regulations.
