If both bits are the same, the result is 0; if they are different, the result is 1. Let's go through this binary number pair step by step:\n\n- First bit (from left): 1 (from 110101) XOR 0 (from 101010) = 1\n- Second bit: 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- Third bit: 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- Fourth bit: 0 XOR 1 = 1\n- Fifth bit: 1 XOR 0 = 1\n- Sixth bit: 0 XOR 1 = 1\n\nAfter performing these operations, we get the binary representation of 100111. However, upon closer inspection, there was an error in my initial explanation. The correct result of this operation should be 100111 because each pair of bits is indeed being compared differently due to XOR's rules. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D) 111111",

The subnet mask in IPv6 indicates the number of used bits for the network identifier and the rest for host identification. If we consider a 6-bit subnet mask, it can divide into four parts because 2^6 equals 64, which fits within 128 (the total number of bits in an IPv6 address). So each part is 16 bits, hence \"6*16 bit\". This allows for 62 hosts per network.",
