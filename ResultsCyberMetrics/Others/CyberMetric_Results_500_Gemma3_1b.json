                "full_llm_response": "Answer: D\nExplanation: Forgiveness is a desirable property because it allows for the system to be used across different jurisdictions and contexts without requiring repeated identification, which is a significant advantage for international travel and data management. The other options are less desirable \u2013 permanent systems are inflexible, transferable systems are easily lost or duplicated, and uniform systems can be problematic for privacy.",

While employee termination policies *could* be a risk, it\u2019s a general policy, not a specific problem addressed by the definition of a security issue.  The other options are all examples of policies designed to address specific concerns.",
