                "full_llm_response": "Answer: A\n\nExplanation: In a Bernoulli process, the output of a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is determined by the state of the last few bits. The autocorrelation function quantifies the correlation between consecutive outputs. For a Bernoulli process with a characteristic polynomial p(z), the autocorrelation function will be the difference between the probabilities of agreement and disagreement in the ith and (i + t)th outcomes.

This creates a security posture where auditing is limited because it\u2019s difficult to prove the security controls are actually effective. It\u2019s also inherently vulnerable to insider threats or reverse-engineering because the attacker can deduce the security measures through analysis.

                "full_llm_response": "Answer: A\n\n**Explanation:**  The preferred approach is to address the immediate risk by denying access to the vulnerable service until a fix is available.  This minimizes the potential damage while allowing for a controlled remediation process. Options B, C, and D are less effective and potentially dangerous.

Kiting is the process of redirecting users to a fake domain after a successful attack.  Domain hijacking is when an attacker gains control of a domain name.

Limiting unnecessary applications reduces the attack surface and makes it harder for attackers to manipulate sessions.  A firewall is a crucial security layer, but it\u2019s not the primary defense against these specific attacks.

Each SYN packet initiates a connection attempt. If the server doesn't respond within a timeout, the connection is closed, and the attacker receives a flood of these closed connections.

FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) are excellent for this due to their low power consumption and the ability to directly implement the required C++ commands. Raspberry Pi is too powerful for the described requirements, Arduino is more focused on embedded systems with some connectivity, and RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) are complex and not ideal for a simple automation task.

                "full_llm_response": "Answer: A) Injection Vulnerabilities\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nInjection vulnerabilities arise from applications failing to properly sanitize user input before it\u2019s processed. Attackers can craft malicious input that, when embedded into the application\u2019s logic, executes code that the application then runs. This allows them to potentially gain unauthorized access, modify data, or execute commands.

                "full_llm_response": "Answer: D\nExplanation: A linear feedback shift register (LFSR) with a primitive characteristic polynomial inherently generates a sequence where the output state is determined by the previous state.  When the initial state is *not* null, the output sequence will always be distinct and periodic with a period of 2N - 1, where N is the number of bits.  Option A is incorrect because a non-null initial state results in a non-repeating sequence. Options B and C are incorrect because LFSRs are designed to produce sequences with a defined pattern, not randomness.",

                "full_llm_response": "Answer: C\nExplanation: VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) fundamentally work by creating a secure, encrypted tunnel for data transmission. This \u201cchannel\u201d is established between your device and a VPN server, effectively masking your real IP address and encrypting your data, which allows for the creation of a network of virtual channels through the Internet.

                "full_llm_response": "Answer: D\n\nExplanation:  Having off-site backups are crucial for several reasons. A catastrophic event can render a physical location inaccessible, destroying data. Off-site backups provide a copy of critical data \u2013 including policy documents, correspondence, and potentially even system logs \u2013 that can be restored quickly and securely, even if the primary location is compromised.
