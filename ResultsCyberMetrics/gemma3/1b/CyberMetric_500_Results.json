                "full_llm_response": "Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary goal of limiting distribution is to safeguard the sensitive information revealed during the penetration test.  Sharing the report with only those who genuinely *need* to know minimizes the risk of compromised data falling into the wrong hands. The other options are secondary considerations \u2013 while maintaining secrecy is important, the core reason for limiting distribution is risk mitigation through confidentiality.",
