SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a cybersecurity expert taking a multiple-choice quiz. Please review the question and the options. Respond ONLY with the letter of the correct option (e.g., A, B, C, or D). You can provide a brief explanation before your final answer if necessary.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?
A) A guideline for user password complexity and rotation policies.
B) A legal document outlining the penalties for a data breach.
C) A list of software vulnerabilities to be patched within a specific timeframe.
D) A statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
D) A statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application. 

Explanation: In cybersecurity, a security requirement is a specific need or condition that must be met to ensure the protection and integrity of data or systems. This can include things like encryption standards, access controls, and other measures designed to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity. It's not merely about guidelines (A), legal documents (B), or patch schedules (C).

USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?
A) Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
B) Plan, Do, Check, and Act.
C) Risk Assessment, Threat Modeling, Penetration Testing, and Auditing.
D) Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Authentication.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A) Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. 

Explanation: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework consists of five core functions: 1) Identify (Understanding the organization's cybersecurity risk), 2) Protect (Implementing safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services), 3) Detect (Developing and implementing appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event), 4) Respond (Developing and implementing an appropriate response plan for each identified cybersecurity event), and 5) Recover (Restoring any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event). The other options do not correctly align with these five functions.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?
A) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
B) Use of Hard-coded Credentials in software.
C) Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting' or XSS).
D) An integer overflow or wraparound condition in memory.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
C) Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting' or XSS). 

Explanation: CWE-79 is a type of vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). It occurs when a web application includes user-controllable input in a web page served to other users without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The options A and D represent different vulnerabilities (SQL Injection and Integer Overflow/Wraparound respectively), while B refers to Hard-coded Credentials which is another distinct cybersecurity issue.

--- EXPECTED ANSWER --- 
C

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.
B) NIS 2 applies only to government entities, while GDPR applies to all private companies.
C) GDPR is legally binding, while NIS 2 is only a set of recommendations.
D) NIS 2 mandates specific technologies like firewalls, while GDPR is technology-neutral.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. 

Explanation: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all companies operating within the EU, regardless of sector, and is designed to protect personal data. On the other hand, the Network and Information Systems (NIS 2) Directive primarily concerns itself with ensuring a high common level of network and information systems security across sectors deemed critical for society, particularly focusing on the operational cybersecurity of these entities.
