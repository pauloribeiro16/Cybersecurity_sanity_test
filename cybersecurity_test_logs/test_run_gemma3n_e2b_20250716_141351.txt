SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are a helpful assistant specialized in cybersecurity topics. Answer the user's question directly and concisely.

USER PROMPT:
What is a security requirement?

LLM RESPONSE:
A security requirement is a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) statement that outlines what needs to be protected and how to protect it. It defines the security goals and constraints for a system or application. 

**Essentially, it's a concrete need for security.**



Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

*   **What to protect:** Data, systems, processes, etc.
*   **How to protect it:**  Specific security controls (e.g., encryption, access controls, monitoring).
*   **Measurable:**  How will you know if the requirement is met?
*   **Relevant:**  Does it address a real security risk?
*   **Time-bound:**  When is the requirement to be met?



Examples:

*   "All sensitive data at rest must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption within 30 days."
*   "User access to critical systems must be restricted to users with a minimum of two levels of authorization."

EXPECTED SHORT ANSWER:
A security requirement is a statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application.
