--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
D) A statement of needed security functionality or a constraint that ensures the security of a system or application. 

Explanation: In cybersecurity, a security requirement refers to a specific need or condition that must be met to ensure the security and integrity of an information system or application. This could include measures like encryption standards, access controls, data protection policies, and more. The other options are related to different aspects of security but do not precisely define what a security requirement is.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?
A) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
B) Use of Hard-coded Credentials in software.
C) Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting' or XSS).
D) An integer overflow or wraparound condition in memory.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
C) Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting' or XSS). 

Explanation: CWE-79 refers to the type of vulnerability known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which occurs when a web application includes user-supplied data in a web page served to other users without proper neutralization. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, leading to potential security breaches and data theft.

--- EXPECTED ANSWER --- 
C

USER PROMPT:
What does STRIDE stand for in threat modeling?
A) System, Threat, Risk, Impact, Defense, and Exposure.
B) Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
C) Secure, Test, Remediate, Implement, Document, and Evaluate.
D) Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Durability, and Resilience.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
B) Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. 

Explanation: STRIDE is a mnemonic used in threat modeling to remember the different types of threats. It stands for: Spoofing (S), Tampering (T), Repudiation (R), Information Disclosure (I), Denial of Service (D), and Elevation of Privilege (E). These categories cover most potential threats in a system.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.
B) NIS 2 applies only to government entities, while GDPR applies to all private companies.
C) GDPR is legally binding, while NIS 2 is only a set of recommendations.
D) NIS 2 mandates specific technologies like firewalls, while GDPR is technology-neutral.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. 

Explanation: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law that focuses on data protection and privacy for individuals within the European Union. It applies to all companies processing personal data of people residing in the EU, regardless of where the company is based. 

On the other hand, the NIS 2 Directive, also known as the Network and Information Systems (NIS 2) regulation, focuses on enhancing cybersecurity across critical sectors such as energy, transportation, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare, drinking water, and digital infrastructure. It emphasizes the operational resilience of these sectors rather than personal data protection.
