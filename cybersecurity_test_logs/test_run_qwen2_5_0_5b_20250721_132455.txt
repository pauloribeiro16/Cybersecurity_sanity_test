What is the purpose of NOP sleds in buffer overflow exploits?
A) To encrypt the payload
B) To alter the content of the NOP register
C) To insert no-operation instructions for padding
D) To alter the content of the EIP register

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
D) To alter the content of the EIP register. NOP (No Operation) sleds are used to bypass modern defenses by inserting zeroed-instructions into the system's execution flow without modifying the memory or data directly, allowing an attacker to execute code after the initial buffer overflow.

C

USER PROMPT:
Which security feature can help prevent buffer overflow attacks by marking certain memory regions as non-executable?
A) Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
B) Buffer Overflow Prevention (BOP)
C) Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
D) Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
B) Buffer Overflow Prevention (BOP)

Explanation: Buffer overflow attacks are a common type of exploit that allow attackers to read memory beyond what is allowed by the operating system's limit. One way to mitigate this is through BOP, which prevents certain types of buffer overflows by making it impossible for an attacker to overwrite data at non-executable locations in memory.

--- EXPECTED ANSWER --- 
A
