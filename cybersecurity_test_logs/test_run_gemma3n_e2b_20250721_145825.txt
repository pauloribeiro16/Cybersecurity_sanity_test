USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?
A) Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
B) Plan, Do, Check, and Act.
C) Risk Assessment, Threat Modeling, Penetration Testing, and Auditing.
D) Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Authentication.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A

**Explanation:**

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) outlines five core functions:

*   **Identify:** Understand and categorize assets and their importance.
*   **Protect:** Implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of assets.
*   **Detect:** Monitor and analyze events to identify potential cybersecurity incidents.
*   **Respond:** Take timely and appropriate actions to contain and mitigate cybersecurity incidents.
*   **Recover:** Restore systems and data to their normal operational state after an incident.



The other options are not the core functions of the NIST CSF.

USER PROMPT:
Which NIST 800-53 control family is primarily responsible for audit and accountability?
A) AC (Access Control)
B) AU (Audit and Accountability)
C) IR (Incident Response)
D) SI (System and Information Integrity)

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
B

**Explanation:**

NIST 800-53 control family AU (Audit and Accountability) is specifically designed to ensure that actions within a system are logged, audited, and that users are held accountable for their actions. This includes tracking user activity, system events, and data modifications. The other families focus on different aspects of security:

*   **AC (Access Control):** Manages who has access to what resources.
*   **IR (Incident Response):** Deals with the process of handling security incidents.
*   **SI (System and Information Integrity):** Focuses on protecting the integrity of system and information assets.
