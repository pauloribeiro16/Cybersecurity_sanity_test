A) RSA-2048
B) AES-256
C) Both of them
D) None of them

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---

What is the purpose of NOP sleds in buffer overflow exploits?
A) To encrypt the payload
B) To alter the content of the NOP register
C) To insert no-operation instructions for padding
D) To alter the content of the EIP register

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
NOP sleds are a series of NOP (no‑operation) instructions added before the shellcode so that the exact jump address does not have to hit the shellcode exactly. They act as a padding zone that increases the probability that the processor will land somewhere within the sled and slide into the payload.
