USER PROMPT:
What are the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)?
A) Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
B) Plan, Do, Check, and Act.
C) Risk Assessment, Threat Modeling, Penetration Testing, and Auditing.
D) Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, and Authentication.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A

Explanation: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) consists of five core functions:

1. Identify: Identify assets, systems, and data that require cybersecurity protection.
2. Protect: Implement controls to protect identified assets from unauthorized access or malicious activity.
3. Detect: Monitor the network for potential security incidents and respond quickly if detected.
4. Respond: Restore systems and data after a security incident, minimizing downtime and damage.
5. Recover: Rebuild systems and restore business operations as soon as possible after a security incident.

These five core functions are designed to provide a structured approach to managing and reducing cybersecurity risk.

USER PROMPT:
What is CWE-79 and what type of vulnerability does it represent?
A) Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection').
B) Use of Hard-coded Credentials in software.
C) Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-Site Scripting' or XSS).
D) An integer overflow or wraparound condition in memory.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A

Explanation: CWE-79, also known as "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command", is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into web applications using specially crafted input data (e.g., user input) to manipulate database operations. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data.

In this case, option A is the correct answer because it accurately describes CWE-79 as a type of SQL Injection vulnerability.

USER PROMPT:
What is the main difference between NIS 2 Directive and GDPR?
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.
B) NIS 2 applies only to government entities, while GDPR applies to all private companies.
C) GDPR is legally binding, while NIS 2 is only a set of recommendations.
D) NIS 2 mandates specific technologies like firewalls, while GDPR is technology-neutral.

--- FULL LLM RESPONSE (for logging) ---
A) GDPR protects personal data across all sectors, while NIS 2 focuses on the operational cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.

Explanation: The Network and Information Systems (NIS) 2 Directive primarily targets the operational cybersecurity of EU critical infrastructure providers, such as power grids, water treatment plants, transportation systems, and financial institutions. In contrast, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects personal data across various sectors in the European Union.
